# personal-tools

This repository is my personal collection of python scripts. Some of them may be useful tools for simple tasks, and others were just little experiments. Feel free to have a look.

### 2D-plot
A straightforward function plotter.

### 3D-plot
Another straightforward function plotter.

### Bifurcation-plot (interesting code)
A tool for easily drawing bifurcation diagrams easily. Logistic-bifurcation-map.png is a nice example output of this.

### Grid-search-algorithm (a bit more complex)
An experiment. Finds a path between a start and end vertex on a grid with obstacles.

### Phaseplane-plot (pretty pictures)
Plots a 2D autonomous system.
