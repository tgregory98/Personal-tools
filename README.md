# Personal-tools

This repo is my personal collection of python scripts. Some of them may be useful tools for simple tasks, and others were just little experiments.

### 2D-plot
A straightforward function plotter.

### 3D-plot
Another straightforward function plotter.

### Bifurcation-plot
A tool for easily drawing bifurcation diagrams easily. Logistic-bifurcation-map.png is a nice example output of this.

### Grid-search-algorithm
An experiment. Finds a path between a start and end vertex on a grid with obstacles.

### Phaseplane-plot
Plots a 2D automonous system.

## Have fun with it!
